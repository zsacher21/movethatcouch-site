      <h1>About MOVE THAT COUCH!</h1>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>MOVE THAT COUCH! helps people connect with nearby independent drivers for single-item or small-load deliveries.</p>
      <p>Customers request a delivery, drivers send quotes, and the customer chooses the option that works best for them.</p>

      <h2>How the platform works</h2>
      <p>MOVE THAT COUCH! is a technology platform. We make it easy for customers and independent drivers to find each other, communicate, and coordinate deliveries.</p>
      <p>MOVE THAT COUCH! does not provide delivery services and is not a carrier, moving company, or freight provider.</p>
      <p>Drivers use their own vehicles, set their own prices, and operate independently.</p>

      <h2>Where MOVE THAT COUCH! operates</h2>
      <p>MOVE THAT COUCH! is intended to be available across the United States (including U.S. territories), subject to driver availability and local requirements.</p>
      <p>The platform is designed for deliveries that can be completed by a single independent driver along a standard drivable route, without shipping or freight services.</p>

      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>When a quote is accepted, a 20% booking deposit is paid in-app to secure the delivery. The remaining balance is paid directly to the driver at delivery.</p>
      <p>Deposit, refund, and cancellation policies are shown before booking.</p>

      <h2>Insurance &amp; responsibility</h2>
      <p>Drivers using MOVE THAT COUCH! are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including any licensing, registration, and insurance requirements.</p>
      <p>Drivers may choose to share insurance information in their profile. Any insurance information is optional, self-reported, and not verified by MOVE THAT COUCH!.</p>
      <p>MOVE THAT COUCH! does not provide insurance and does not perform deliveries.</p>

      <h2>Platform &amp; driver roles</h2>
      <p>Drivers are independent and are not employees, agents, or contractors of MOVE THAT COUCH!. All delivery services are provided by the driver you choose.</p>

      <h2>Why MOVE THAT COUCH! exists</h2>
      <p>Small deliveries shouldn’t be complicated. MOVE THAT COUCH! was built to make moving a single item faster, clearer, and more flexible for both customers and drivers.</p>

      <h2>Legal</h2>
      <p>For full details about how the platform works, please review our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
